         * data structure that stores elements in a hierarchy.

         * root : the top node in tree
         * application: 1)people in our organization 2)DataBase 3)Auto completion 4)compilers -> syntax tree to parse expressions
         * binary tree = binary search tree -> because allow us to quickly look up data.
         * In a binary search tree, the value of any node is always greater than the value of leftChild
         * and smaller than rightChild
         * logarithmic time:
         *  lookUp --> o(log n)
         *  insert --> o(log n)
         *  delete --> o(log n)
